      <p>While the term <i>philologist</i> has become outdated, I've gone ahead and adopted the label for myself. In part this is because I have no formal training as a linguist and want to avoid that misinterpreation. But also it is because I feel that both etymologically and historically, the project of <i>philology</i> describes clearly, even romantically, my relationship with language related research. The term comes from the Greek <font size="4px">φίλος</font> (phílos) "love," and <font size="4px">λόγος</font> (lógos) "the word," and refers by and large to what we today would call historical linguistics. Vocabulary, the evolution of its meanings through language and time, and the development of the sounds that compose and transform them, is the primary unit with which the philologist concerns himself. While I take an interest in all branches of linguistics to one degree or another (morphology, grammar, syntax, phonology, and the like), I see myself as fundamentally attracted to linguistics through my obsession with words and their evolution. Philologists use ancient texts and literature to better understand the relationship between potentially related languages, sorting them into families, and reconstructing proto-languages from similar words .
