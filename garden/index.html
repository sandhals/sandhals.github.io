<p>Hello, and welcome to the garden! Here I keep a modest list of some mini-sites (many, <a href="https://sundaysites.cafe/">Sunday Sites</a>) that I've made. Some are finished, some are still sort of being built, but feel free to poke your nose around and see for yourself! To read a bit about each site, you can pull down a description by clicking the coloured dot next to the site title. Unfinished sites have been listed in grey!</p>
<ul class="sites" style="margin-left:-15px;">
    <li ><details><summary><a href="loveletter">Sunday Site 23: Love Letter </a><span class="new">[new!]</span></summary>
        <div class="description">After feeling stumped on this prompt for a little while, a memory from earlier this year came rushing back to me.</div> </details></li>  
    <li ><details><summary><a href="cafes">Cafés in Seoul </a><span class="new">[new!]</span></summary>
        <div class="description">A curated list of some of my favourite cafés here in Seoul.</div> </details></li>      
    <li><details><summary><a href="http://textflection.glitch.me/">Sunday Site 22: Textflections </a><span class="new">[new!]</span></summary>
        <div class="description">The prompt for this Sunday Site was "reflections." I wrote a small paragraph reflecting on the word, some of its implication, and structured the site's design around some of the thoughts therein. Each letter of the text appears as a reflected version of itself, hiding its lower half, but interacting with each word will reveal its full form. Between you and me, if it's too troublesome to read the whole text this way, if you hover your mouse beneath the bottom right corner of the textbox and wait a moment, a link to a cheat version of the page will appear!</div></details></li>
    <li><details><summary><a href="sketchbook">My Sketchbook </a><span class="new">[new!]</span></summary>
        <div class="description">This year (2022) I started drawing again. I try to keep it updated regularly, so if you are interested to see what I've been sketching, feel free to have a look!</div> </details></li>
    <li><details><summary><a href="http://windowhaiku.glitch.me/">Sunday Site 17: Window Haiku</a></summary>
        <div class="description">The topic for this Sunday Site was "weather." I sort of strayed from the prompt itself, but my mind sort of lingered on the sky as the stage on which weather is always manifesting. If you rest your mouse in the center of the screen, a colourful sky will reveal itself, and as you scroll through it, you can watch its colours change. Each time you stop, a tooltip containing a haiku by Issa will appear to go along with it!</div></details></li>
    <li><details><summary><a href="http://memoryquilt.glitch.me/">Sunday Site 15: Memory Quilt</a></summary>
        <div class="description">This is site made with the folks at Sunday Sites in January of 2021. Our topic was "something positive from this year." While 2020 was the first year of the pandemic, it was also my last year in Japan after living their nearly five years, and was the year I went back to Canada after a two year gap being away. I chose to build a "quilt" of memories by stitching together multiple videos I took that year and added a small caption for each one. The idea at Sunday Sites is to make a site in a short amount of time using on HTML and CSS, but I felt it worked sort of clunkily, so the version I am linking here uses a little bit of JavaScript, but you can find a link to an HTML/CSS-only version with the link at the top. Each piece of the quilt contains a video so the website will take a long time to load completely, but please, if you have the time, open it, leave it, and come back to peruse!</div> </details></li>
    <li><details><summary><a href="influences">Table of Influences</a></summary>
        <div class="description">The idea for this site first came to me as an image. I knew I wanted to create a large, blank page covered with names, all scattered about. I decided to list the names of individuals whose work and persona have inspired me in my own creative pursuits. I decided to plot them according to some sort of schema, and in the end decided to define my axes in terms of substance and beauty (artists whose work I appreciate for its content vs artists whose work I appreciate for its presentation) and persona and work (artists whom I admire for the way their public image and persona is expressed as an artist and artists who I primarily admire for their craft).</div> </details></li>           
     <li><details><summary><a href="natalchart">Reading My Natal Chart</a></summary>
         <div class="description">This was a very fun site to make. I love to play with the hover feature in CSS. It's amazing the degree of live, in-the-moment interactivity you can accomplish with just a little bit of CSS. Late in 2021, I picked up my deep-rooted obsession with astrology again, and started trying to understand how to read charts with all of their components in mind. This site records a few of my findings as I've studied using my own chart!</div> </details></details></li>
                    
    <li class="wips"><details><summary>A Brief History of My Computer</summary>
        <div class="description">This is site is still largely unfinished, but like with my table of influences page, the idea for the design came before the content. I knew I wanted to make a scrolling timeline, and later decided it might be fun to dedicate it to my very long history as a person who actively spends time online and on his computer. </div> </details></li>
    <li class="wips"><details><summary>An Ode to <small>「ん」</small></summary>
        <div class="description">A poetry\website project I am building to explore the kana ん.</div> </details></details></li>
    <li class="wips"><details><summary>On Bodybuilding</summary>
        <div class="description">I am have built the design of the site, but I am unsure what I want to do exactly for the site's content. Either a practical guide, or perhaps more of a treatise? Maybe a bit of both? </div> </details></li>
