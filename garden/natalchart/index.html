      <a href="#" class="first house">I</a>
      <div class="housedescription" id="i">i. This is the first house, the house of identity, self, and appearances. It reveals the part of the sky that was emerging beyond the horizon at the moment of my birth, my first celestial pronouncement. My rising sign is in Libra, positioned almost perfectly in the centre of the constellation, and inside it, Venus, the morning star, sits exactly upon the horizon, slowly making its ascent into the sky. This is one of the more auspicious parts of my chart since my Libra rising makes Venus the ruler of my chart. Libra and Venus are both very preoccupied with beauty and aesthetics, and being in the first house, they point strongly to my general feeling that, be something useful or useless, for pleasure or for learning, be they decor or tools, the bottom line is that they must be beautiful. <br>
     I also have my Venus, the planet of love, positioned square to both Uranus, the planet of rebellion, and Saturn, the planet of delusion. I think this reveals a general discomfort with stagnancy in my romantic life and a desire to be in constant growth and movement with a partner (Uranus), but also it points to my tendency to over-romanticize my feelings, or my inability to let go of feelings I have for people I love (Neptune).<br><br></div>
      <a href="#" class="second house">II</a>
      <div class="housedescription" id="ii">ii. My second house, the house of possessions and value, is ruled by Scorpio, and in it we find two planets, Jupiter and Pluto.</div>
      <a href="#" class="third house">III</a>
      <div class="housedescription" id="iii">iii. The third house, the house of sharing and communication, is an empty house, ruled by Sagittarius. The ruling planet of Sagittarius is Jupiter, and therefore, Jupiter is the caretaker of this part of my life, the supplier, the manager and delegator of its resources. Jupiter being a planet of abundance and growth, I interpret Jupiter as being generous with giving me thoughts and ideas which I may want to communicate, and with Jupiter being in Scorpio in my chart, I see him as perhaps throwing me materials more within the realm of the esoteric and spiritual. I also see this as pointing toward a tendency in conversation to move toward hidden topics, and perhaps looking for opportunities or people with whom I can divulge some of my own secrets or spiritual ideas with.<br><br></div>
      <a href="#" class="fourth house">IV</a>
      <div class="housedescription" id="iv">iv. The fourth house is the house of the private life, security, and the home, positioned in Capricorn. Here I have placements of Neptune, the planet of dreams and delusion, and Uranus, the planet of rebellion, eccentricity, and sudden change. I see these all pointing toward my somewhat hectic childhood, and its many sudden shifts of authority figures and circumstance, and an overall theme of chaos in the home. As I have grown older and moved away from the home, these energies still express themselves perhaps in my tendencies both to romanticize or create idols or symbols of certain moments in my past, but also my tendency to be removed from the family and home. These planets being ruled by Capricorn points at once to my diligence and busyness as a child, involved in many activities, always working and occupied, but also to my psychological relationship to my past as I've matured, one which approaches it systematically, almost as something to decode as systematically as possible. I cherish my home, it occupies my creative mind constantly (note that Uranus, the ruler of the House of Creative Energy, the Fifth House, is here in my fourth house), and despite its turbulence, it is something I contemplate fondly and with deep intrigue (Neptune). And yet as my mind leans into it abstractly, in all realms of practical action, I find myself often leaning away from it, often too far away(Uranus). Even with my family and family life constantly on the mind, I can fall into long bouts of silence, and seem to crave great distance from it physically.<br><br></div>
      <a href="#" class="fifth house">V</a>
      <div class="housedescription" id="v">v. The house of pleasure, children, sex, and creative self expression is in Aquarius. This house is also empty, so I look to Aquarius' ruling planet, Uranus, to see who and what is delegating the content and thought behind my creative pursuits. Uranus is a rebel, craving novelty, surprise, and shock. Here I see the breadth of my creative interest manifested, my love of unexpected form, and unlikely metaphor. Uranus also being positioned in the fourth house also maybe points to my fascination with biography, be that my own or other's. When I discover a piece of art I like, my first instinct is often to dig into the artist's past, and likewise my mind often goes there myself when I am creating. Perhaps this is the work of Uranus, my daemon in the distance.<br><br></div>
      <a href="#" class="sixth house">VI</a>
      <div class="housedescription" id="vi">vi. The house of illness, work, duty, and subordinates in Pisces. Saturn is often thought of a difficult planet. He restricts, and reveals responsibility. The planet is often associated with difficulties in a persons chart, but if I am trying to look at his position descriptively and productively here, I see him as a focusing force in my work life. He wants my labour to be concentrated, and diligently adhered to. But the presence of the Moon here alongside Saturn I think poses a challenge to Saturn. Where Saturn attempts to restrict me into a stability, the Moon, one of most mercurial planets, instead does not want to settle. It is apt to change, seek new kinds of work, adapt and move around as the heart does. I think this speaks volumes to my work ethic, but also my tendency to have a hard time dedicating my working self to any one career. My Pisces here is ruled by Neptune, and so it is the planet of dreams and delusion who is tasked with helping these planets exercise their will in the house of work, and so perhaps all of this is for the worst, but it certainly feels like an accurate description. I think seeing my Saturn in opposition to my Sun often means that when I am listening to myself, questioning my identity and my place in the world, my rigid, more industrial Saturn takes a backseat, and my Moon takes the wheel. The whole ordeal is coloured by the sign of Pisces, a sign known for its emotional depth. I think all of this points to a clear tendency to follow my heart in matters of work, but analyzing this placement has made me think that my Sun would do well to take lessons from Saturn once in a while as well.<br><br></div>
      <a href="#" class="seventh house">VII</a>
      <div class="housedescription" id="vii">vii. The house of relationships, you and the other, marriage, partnership.</div>
      <a href="#" class="eighth house">VIII</a>
      <div class="housedescription" id="viii">viii. The house of death, inheritance, the assets of others.</div>
      <a href="#" class="ninth house">IX</a>
      <div class="housedescription" id="ix">ix. The house of travel, foreign places/people, education, and religion.</div>
      <a href="#" class="tenth house">X</a>
      <div class="housedescription" id="x">x. The house of career, and public reputation.</div>
      <a href="#" class="eleventh house">XI</a>
      <div class="housedescription" id="xi">xi. The house of friends, groups, alliances, and hope.</div>
      <a href="#" class="twelfth house">XII</a>
      <div class="housedescription" id="xii">xii. House of loss, seclusion, and self-undoing. I've read in a few places that the sun in the twelfth house can be correlated with the death of one's father at a young age. In my case, my father passed when I was nine years old, and my younger brother shares the same placement of the sun in his twelfth house.</div>
