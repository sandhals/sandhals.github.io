i posted to instagram asking people for ideas and requests for things to draw! this resulted in:
<br><br>
a sexy mermaid; 
a lizard doing laundry; 
curious george; 
a crane in a patch of flowers; 
my older sister Lyric's two beautiful daughters (crying, but still looking very cute hehe); 
a hamster with a flower growing from its head; 
and a sketch of a photo from my own instagram feed that i like (from a trip to Chikubushima, an island in the middle of Lake Biwa)
